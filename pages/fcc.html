            <p class="project_cat_desc">FreeCodeCamp (as the name implies) is a completely free coding resource that I have only begun
                to scratch the surface on! It is a phenomal resource to quickly accelerate through learning various coding 
                language topics, while providing free certifications for their users.
                You can learn more about their certificates <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank"

            <h3 class="project_cat_subtitle">Responsive Web Design</h3>
            <p class="project_cat_subdesc">An introduction to HTML for webpage content and CSS for stylization. The most basic of all
                of my coding ventures, but a step I was excited to include in my portfolio page regardless. These truly help to
                reflect on the journey of a beginner.

                After learning the fundamentals, the course moves to creating algorithms to manipulate strings, factorialize numbers, 
                and even calculate the orbit of the International Space Station. Two key concepts: Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
